# Image Editor

This is a Python-based image editor that allows users to interactively select a square area of an image, which can then be converted to either grayscale or negative. The editor uses Tkinter for the graphical interface and graphics.py for rendering the image and interaction elements.

## Features

- **Select a Square:** Click and drag to select a square area on the image.
- **Apply Effects:** Convert the selected area to either grayscale or negative.
- **Save Edited Image:** Save the edited image to a location of your choice.

## Requirements
